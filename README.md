**Waze Churn Prediction 🚗📉**

This project is part of the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate (Capstone Project).
The goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a Waze user is likely to churn (stop using the app), and to generate actionable insights that help improve user retention.

**📌 Problem Statement**

Waze, a popular navigation app, wants to proactively reduce churn. By identifying at-risk users, the company can design targeted interventions such as personalized reminders, promotions, or feature enhancements.

**🎯 Objectives**

Predict the probability of user churn.

Identify key drivers of churn using machine learning and explainable AI.

Provide data-driven recommendations to improve user retention.

**🛠️ Tech Stack**

Languages: Python

Libraries: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

Modeling: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost

Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

Explainability: Feature importance, SHAP values
